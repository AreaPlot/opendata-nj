# ABP

The Alternative Benefits Program is an alternative retirement system for state
employees in higher education. 

The ABP rolls are not available on [YourMoney.nj.gov](https://yourmoney.nj.gov), so they must be requested
via [OPRA Request form](https://nj.gov/opra/).

Upon receipt of the ABP rolls as an Excel document, use processABP.sh to convert the spreadsheet to CSV.
